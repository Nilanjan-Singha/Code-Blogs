# ALL CODING LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS EXPLAINED

## WEBDEV 

### FRONTEND

- HTML : websites ka structure ya skeleton banne k liye

- CSS : designing the website with colors, ui components, etc. if you wanna deep dive into designing sites, look up ui/ux

- JS : adding functionality to site. bas landing page banne se ghar nhi chalta, functional web apps to actually do something

> itna tak frontend ka tech stack tha but jab you start making somewhat big projects, har bar dom-manipulation, reloading while routing, bulky code, starts getting problematic. isliye some new languages frameworks to be precise aaye to make frontend easy.

- React : built on the concept on components n resuabilty. like you have a product page with many cards, so u make one card and just keep updating the values to make shit dynamic

- Angular: more full fledged. react mei you import many libraries koi kam karne k liye but angular mei inbuilt aati h like  routing, requests, http, etc. more structure but a bit hard to understand at first

- Typescript : Javascript but har chiz k liye you gotta mention types bolte toh number, string, void wagera. became popular q ki code debug karne mei easy rehta. 

> itna tak thik tha but coders got lazy to even write css, so market mei boht saare css k frameworks aaye. tailwind css, bootstrap, chakra ui, material ui, etc. ab you write just inline shorthand css styles or u directly import prestyled buttons, forms, etc or bas unke andar ka text change kardo. 

### EXTRA FRONTEND 

Sites toh banali but ab usko animate karna chahte ho, then fir abko kuch naye libraries learn or add karne padenge. 
- GSAP, Framer motion, AnimeJS,etc
- 3d animation k liye Three.JS, BabylonJS, react-three-js

Thoda research karoge then you will get to know ki there are many lib to work with pdfs, images, videos, text-editors, markdown, json and what not. ye sab ko bas use karni aani chahiye. 

iske bad you get to know about cloud hosting your images, videos, pdfs, databses, everything. time to build big. 

hosting sites like ImgKit, Cloudinary, Firebase Storage, Kraken, own VPS etc mei you upload your stuff and then you try playing with their sdk to connect your website to fetch the data.
