# ✍️ Code Blogs

**Code Blogs** is my personal space on the internet where I jot down things I learn while building cool stuff — from websites and mobile apps to robots, AI models, and open source tools.

The fun part? I write all posts in simple Markdown files, drop them in the `public/` folder, and the site auto-magically turns them into clean, readable HTML pages using a custom **Markdown parser**. No CMS, no fuss.

* 🧼 Clean, minimal layout
* 📱 Fully responsive (read on any screen)

## 🛠️ How It Works

Tech used:

* React or Next.js (depending on your setup)
* Markdown parser (like `marked`, `remark`, or custom)
* Tailwind CSS or plain HTML/CSS for styling

You write `.md` files, drop them in:

```bash
/public/blogs/
```

Example:

```bash
/public/blogs/my-first-blog.md
```

…and it's live. That’s it!
